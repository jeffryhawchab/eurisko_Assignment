# Academy Assignments - TypeScript Solutions

## Overview
This project contains solutions for multiple coding challenges written in TypeScript. Each challenge is implemented as a separate function and demonstrates efficient problem-solving techniques.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Reverse a String
**Description:**
Reverses a given string.

### 2. Count Vowels
**Description:**
Counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

### 3. Find the Missing Number
**Description:**
Finds the missing number in an array of numbers from 1 to N.

### 4. Find the First Non-Repeating Character
**Description:**
Returns the first non-repeating character in a string.

### 5. Deep Object Comparison
**Description:**
Compares two objects deeply for equality.

### 6. LRU Cache Implementation
**Description:**
Implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache with `get(key)` and `put(key, value)` operations.

### 7. TypeScript Task Manager
**Description:**
Implements a simple task manager with functions to add, complete, and display tasks.

## How to Run
### Option 1: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
1. Install TypeScript (if not installed):
   ```sh
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
2. Compile the TypeScript file:
   ```sh
   tsc filename.ts
   ```
3. Run the generated JavaScript file:
   ```sh
   node filename.js
   ```

### Option 2: Run TypeScript Directly with ts-node
1. Install ts-node (if not installed):
   ```sh
   npm install -g ts-node
   ```
2. Run the TypeScript file:
   ```sh
   ts-node filename.ts
   ```

## Notes
- This project is written in TypeScript for type safety.
- Each challenge solution is stored in a separate file.
- Solutions are optimized for readability and performance.
